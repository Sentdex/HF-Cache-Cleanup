# HF-Cache-Cleanup

A simple script to cleanup cached models. I was kind of surprised that this wasnt a feature in the transformers library (did I miss it?)

I finally just ended up writing my own script to make it a bit easier to manage. Quick and dirty, but helped and I honestly just wanted to save it somewhere lol. 

To-do:

- Could handle for other operating systems, currently it's just linux.
For macOS: ~/Library/Caches/huggingface/transformers
For Windows: C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Local\huggingface\transformers
